# Group Action Exercises

## Important

This is WIP right now. Feedback welcome in `issues`.

# What is this repo?

A collection of exercises intended to teach a student who is proficient
in group theory how to use Lean's inbuilt theory of group actions.

Thanks to Ines Wright for asking good questions.

# How to play?

## The proper way

1) Install the leanprover-community python tool `leanproject`, giving
you the ability to download Lean projects onto your computer. Instructions
on how to do this are on the [community website](https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html).

2) `leanproject get ImperialCollegeLondon/group-action-exercises` in the command line
(yes I know, we're working on it)

3) Open the new folder `group-action-exercises` which has just appeared
on your computer.

Have a play with `level_1_groups.lean` in the `/src` directory, and
the other files in that directory.

## the quick way

You think you're saving time, but Lean runs much slower, so if
you play for long enough you'll have lost outright.
